Build a lifelong library of personal knowledge without the burden of upfront organization.

MyLifeDB implements a dual-zone architecture: an **Inbox** for frictionless capture and a **Library** for curated, structured knowledge. AI observes your patterns and suggests organization—you stay in control.

### Core Philosophy

**Frictionless capture** — Zero cognitive overhead. Never think "where should this go?"

**AI-assisted structure** — Intelligent pattern recognition with user control. AI suggests, you decide.

**Data ownership** — Full control and portability. No vendor lock-in. Markdown and JSON formats.

**Local-first** — Core functionality works offline. Your data stays on your machine.

### How It Works

1. **Capture anything** — Text, links, voice, files. Quick-add with `⌘N`.
2. **AI processes** — Auto-tagging, similarity detection, clustering runs in the background.
3. **Weekly reflection** — Review AI-suggested clusters, confirm or dismiss.
4. **Spaces emerge** — Your Library organizes itself based on your decisions.

### The Dual-Zone Model

**Inbox** — Light, airy, motion-forward. A river of thoughts. Speed and freedom.

**Library** — Warm, stable, reflective. A well-organized bookshelf. Calm and permanence.

### Smart Features

- **Semantic search** — Find ideas by meaning, not just keywords
- **Cross-Space relations** — Discover connections between topics
- **Insights & Principles** — Promote patterns to permanent truths
- **URL crawling** — Save web pages with screenshots and extracted content

No gamification. No badges. Just a calm, reflective space for your knowledge.
