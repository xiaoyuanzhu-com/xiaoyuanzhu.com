What if adding AI to your homelab app was as simple as a REST call?

Homelab AI makes it happen. Deploy a single Docker container, and you get instant access to powerful AI capabilities—image understanding, semantic search embeddings, and smart web scraping that handles JavaScript-heavy sites.

No Python dependencies to manage. No ML infrastructure to maintain. Just clean APIs that work from any language.

### What's Inside

**Image Understanding** — Send an image, get a description. Perfect for auto-tagging photos, accessibility features, or content moderation.

**Text to Vectors** — Convert text into embeddings for semantic search. Build recommendation systems or enhance your search without understanding the math.

**Smart Web Scraping** — Give it a URL, get clean text back. Handles modern JavaScript sites and optionally captures screenshots.

### Built for Developers

The configuration dashboard lets you manage models visually—no command-line expertise required. The API explorer provides interactive docs with copy-paste examples. And the monitoring view shows exactly how your apps are using AI.

Works with or without GPU. Configure through environment variables or a simple config file. Add API key auth when exposing to the network.

Developer adds AI in under 30 minutes. That's the goal.
