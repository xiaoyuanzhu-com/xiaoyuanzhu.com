Ever wonder what your entire life looks like on a single screen?

Lifetime shows you. Enter your birthday, and watch as ~1000 tiny squares appear—each one a month of your life. Some already filled. Some waiting. One glowing softly: right now.

Scroll down and the view shifts. Your year spreads out as 365 days. Then deeper still—your day, minute by minute, the current one pulsing gently like a heartbeat.

That's it. No goals to set. No streaks to maintain. Just a quiet window into time itself.

Keep it open while you work. Glance at it when you need perspective. Let it sit in a forgotten tab until you remember it's there.

Time is passing either way. Lifetime just helps you see it.
